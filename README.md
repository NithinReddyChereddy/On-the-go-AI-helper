This lightweight desktop application brings the power of Google's Gemini AI directly to your fingertips, designed for speed and convenience in its source code form.

Whether you're brainstorming ideas, summarizing notes, or just curious, this helper makes interacting with AI a seamless part of your workflow. Just set it up, ask away, and let the AI do the heavy lifting!

‚ú® What Can It Do? (Key Features)
Instant AI Answers: Get rapid responses to your text-based questions and prompts, powered by the advanced Gemini 1.5 Pro model.

Intuitive Text Input: Simply type your queries into the input field.

Drag-and-Drop Text Integration: Easily drag and drop text snippets directly into the input field for quick processing. No more endless copy-pasting!

File Content Insertion: Browse and select text files (.txt) to automatically load their content into your input field, preparing it for an AI query.

Stealth Mode Toggle: Quickly hide or show the application window with the F2 hotkey.

Adjustable Transparency: Fine-tune the app's transparency with the F3 hotkey, allowing you to work with it discreetly in the background.

Draggable Interface: Position the window anywhere on your screen for maximum comfort.

Clear Chat History: Reset the conversation with a dedicated "Clear Chat" button.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started (Installation & Setup)
Getting this helper up and running from source code is straightforward!

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/On-the-go-AI-helper.git
cd On-the-go-AI-helper

If you're downloading directly from GitHub (via "Code" -> "Download ZIP"), extract the contents and navigate into the folder.

Create a Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended):
This keeps your project dependencies tidy.

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies:

pip install requests tkinterdnd2 keyboard

Google Gemini API Key:

For this v1.0 version, the Gemini API key needs to be inserted directly into the src/code_2.py file.

Open src/code_2.py in a text editor.

Find the line: API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" # Replace with your API key

Replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your actual Google Gemini API Key obtained from Google AI Studio.

Save the file.

Important Note for Future Versions: While direct insertion is used for simplicity in this initial release, the plan for upcoming versions is to implement a more secure method (like an interactive input slot or environment variables), ensuring API key confidentiality and best practices for deployment.

üöÄ How to Use It
Run the application:

python src/code_2.py

Start Chatting: Type your question or prompt into the input box at the bottom. Press the Enter key on your keyboard or click the "Ask" button to send your query to the AI.

Quick Input: Drag any plain text from another application and drop it onto the input field. It will appear there, ready for you to send to the AI.

Hotkeys for Control:

Press F2 to hide or show the application window instantly.

Press F3 to cycle through transparency levels.

Stay tuned for updates as this helper evolves!
